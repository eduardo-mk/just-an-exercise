# just-an-exercise

This is just an execise to handle the state of a table and some of its props.

## Installation

```console
npm install
```

## Execute the project

```console
npm run dev
```

## Run test

WIP

```console
npm run test
```

## Briefly explanation of my thinking

-   Hanlde the state of the exercise with reducers, this will make easier to trigger actions
    and share the dispatch object.

-   Centralize logic: In this case in the App component, this helped me to deal with presentational component,
    handling data and updating separately, making it a little bit easier to maintain.

-   I did not add CSS (Just the basic).

-   I tried to add test to the code is more protected for future regression issues.

-   I added typescript to contributre with the overall documentation of the project.

-   I assummed that names are unique so I took advantage of it.
